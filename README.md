# owo-bot-player
A program that hunts, battles, reequips gems, and prays in discord's owo bot.

The program starts by asking what gems to use and how many hunts until it needs to reequip gems. Then, it attempts to find discord's text box so it can start sending messages. If it cannot find the text box, it will ask the user to try again or select it manually. To select manually, simply select that option and left click on discord's text box. 

Known limitations:
This program cannot read anything off of discord. Therefore, it will not stop if the bot asks the user to solve a captcha.
This also means it cannot react to any lag preventing a hunt. This can lead to gems not being reequipped for a full set of hunts.
The image search does not work on any monitor greater than 1080p.
